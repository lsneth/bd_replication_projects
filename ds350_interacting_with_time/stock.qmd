Most of the decisions made for these visualizations were made by the class and Brother Hathaway as a whole haha. The only part I did alone was the one year chart.

They basically show stock value history for 11 companies. The first chart over several years, the second chart over the year of 2023. The last chart specifically focuses on Target.

```{python}
import polars as pl 
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from datetime import datetime
from lets_plot import *
LetsPlot.setup_html()
```

```{python}
pdat = pl.read_parquet("stock.parquet")
```

```{python} 
# Create a time series chart that shows performance of all 10 stocks.
plot = ggplot(pdat, aes(x='Date', y='AdjClose', color='ticker')) + \
 geom_line() +\
 scale_x_datetime() +\
 labs(
    x="Date", 
    y="Adjusted Closing Price", 
    title="My chart of the top 10 stocks"
)
plot.show() 
```

```{python}
# pdat.head()
```

```{python}
# now fix the html size and only show the last year and save the chart
dat2 = pdat.filter(pl.col("Date").dt.year() == 2023)

plot2 = ggplot(dat2, aes(x='Date', y='AdjClose', color='ticker')) + \
    geom_line() +\
    scale_x_datetime() +\
    labs(
        x="Date",
        y="Adjusted Closing Price",
        title="My chart of the top 10 stocks in 2023"
    ) + ggsize(800, 500)

plot2.show()
``` 

```{python} 
## plotly candlestick chart
# https://plotly.com/python/candlestick-charts/
df=pdat.filter(pl.col('ticker') == "TGT")

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(x=df['Date'],
                open=df['Open'],
                high=df['High'],
                low=df['Low'],
                close=df['Close'])])

fig.show()
```
